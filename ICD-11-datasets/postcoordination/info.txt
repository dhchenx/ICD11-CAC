				Pulmonary toxoplasmosis in the immunodeficient patient may appear in the form of interstitial pneumonitis, necrotizing pneumonitis, consolidation, pleural effusion, or empyema, or all of these.[1]
				AIDS patients with Toxoplasma pneumonia present with cough, dyspnea, and fever. As toxoplasmosis is generally seen only in advanced HIV infection with CD4 counts below 100, the majority of AIDS patients who develop toxoplasma pneumonia already have had previous HIV-associated opportunistic infections. In solid organ transplant patients, this is most commonly due to transplantation of a toxoplasma-seropositive lung or heart into a seronegative recipient, resulting in primary pulmonary disease. In bone marrow transplant patients, pulmonary toxoplasmosis occurs in 0.28% to 0.45% of patients. Unlike solid organ transplant patients, most of these patients have reactivation, not primary disease.[2]

It shows marked geographic differences, with highest incidence rates in Southern Chinese. In some endemic areas, the incidence has declined by about 30% over the past two decades, suggesting that environmental or lifestyle factors may play a major role and that the disease is, to some extent, preventable. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma shows a very strong association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, irrespective of the ethnic origin of the patients. This association has pioneered a new paradigm of utilizing viral serological tests for the diagnosis of cancer and for screening in high-risk populations. Naso -pharyngeal carcinoma is generally responsive to radiation therapy, and the clinical outcome has greatly improved over the years, due to refinements in staging and to improved therapy protocols. The unusual and often deceptive histological features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma have generated controversies over the nature of the tumour and still pose a challenge to surgical pathologists.

Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma."

They occur in all world regions, with a preference for developed countries. Etiological factors include environmental carcinogens (tobacco smoking) and lifestyle factors, in particular obesity. Although renal tumours can be completely removed surgically, haematogeneous metastasis is frequent and may occur already at an early stage of the disease. The pattern of somatic mutations in kidney tumours has been extensively investigated and has become, in addition to histopathology, a major criterion for classification. Kidney tumours also occur in the setting of several inherited cancer syndromes, including von Hippel-Lindau disease."

Small ulcers are almost invariably confined to the periphery of the cornea, especially its inferior and nasal aspects. The ulceration may be shallow, but is commonly deep. Perforations become plugged with iris, thereby preserving the anterior chamber. In more advanced disease the necrotic stroma sloughs, leaving a large ulcer or descemetocele.

The classical clinical symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency are a seborrheic dermatitis, microcytic anaemia, epileptiform convulsions, and depression and confusion. Infants are especially susceptible to insufficient intakes, which can lead to epileptiform convulsions. Moreover, there is usually a decrease in circulating lymphocytes and sometimes a normocytic, microcytic, or sideroblastic anaemia as well. As is the case with other micronutrient deficiencies, vitamin B6 deficiency results in an impairment of the immune system.

http://id.who.int/icd/entity/439233336	5B5E	definition	"Nutritional deficiency of folate is common in people consuming a limited diet. This can be exacerbated by malabsorption conditions, including coeliac disease and tropical sprue. Pregnant women are at risk for folate deficiency because pregnancy significantly increases the folate requirement, especially during periods of rapid fetal growth (i.e. in the second and third trimester). During lactation, losses of folate in milk also increase the folate requirement. During pregnancy, there is an increased risk of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs), with risk increasing 10-fold as folate status goes from adequate to poor. Between days 21 and 27 post-conception, the neural plate closes to form what will eventually be the spinal cord and cranium. Spina bifida, anencephaly, and other similar conditions are collectively called NTDs. They result from improper closure of the spinal cord and cranium, respectively, and are the most common congenital abnormalities associated with folate deficiency."

Clinical findings are: dermatitis, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia. The role of EFA during pregnancy and lactation has been highlighted, and the role of long-chain n-3 fatty acids as structural components for the development of the retinal function and central nervous system is now accepted. The prenatal period is a time of increased risk for omega-3 deficiency, as maternal tissue stores tend to decline as they are used for the developing fetus. Deficiency of n-3 EFA can affect growth, and cognitive and visual function in infants. The characteristic signs of deficiency attributed to the n-6 fatty acids are scaly skin rash, increased transepidermal water loss, reduced growth, and elevation of the plasma ratio of eicosatrienoic acid: arachidonic acid. EFA deficiency in special populations has been linked to hematologic disturbances and diminished immune response.

Coordinated motor skills are substantially below that expected given the individual's chronological age and level of intellectual functioning. Onset of coordinated motor skills difficulties occurs during the developmental period and is typically apparent from early childhood. Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in functioning (e.g., in activities of daily living, school work, and vocational and leisure activities).

The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning and significantly interferes with academic, occupational, or social functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organization. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences.

Mood disorders are defined according to particular types of mood episodes and their pattern over time. The primary types of mood episodes are Depressive episode, Manic episode, Mixed episode, and Hypomanic episode. Mood episodes are not independently diagnosable entities, and therefore do not have their own diagnostic codes. Rather, mood episodes make up the primary components of most of the Depressive and Bipolar Disorders."

A manic episode is an extreme mood state lasting at least one week unless shortened by a treatment intervention characterized by euphoria, irritability, or expansiveness, and by increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy, accompanied by other characteristic symptoms such as rapid or pressured speech, flight of ideas, increased self-esteem or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, impulsive or reckless behavior, and rapid changes among different mood states (i.e., mood lability). A mixed episode is characterized by either a mixture or very rapid alternation between prominent manic and depressive symptoms on most days during a period of at least 2 weeks. Although the diagnosis can be made based on evidence of a single manic or mixed episode, typically manic or mixed episodes alternate with depressive episodes over the course of the disorder."

Disturbances affect some areas of personality functioning but not others (e.g., problems with self-direction in the absence of problems with stability and coherence of identity or self-worth), and may not be apparent in some contexts. There are problems in many interpersonal relationships and/or in performance of expected occupational and social roles, but some relationships are maintained and/or some roles carried out. Specific manifestations of personality disturbances are generally of mild severity. Mild Personality Disorder is typically not associated with substantial harm to self or others, but may be associated with substantial distress or with impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning that is either limited to circumscribed areas (e.g., romantic relationships; employment) or present in more areas but milder."

Disturbances affect multiple areas of personality functioning (e.g., identity or sense of self, ability to form intimate relationships, ability to control impulses and modulate behaviour). However, some areas of personality functioning may be relatively less affected. There are marked problems in most interpersonal relationships and the performance of most expected social and occupational roles are compromised to some degree. Relationships are likely to be characterized by conflict, avoidance, withdrawal, or extreme dependency (e.g., few friendships maintained, persistent conflict in work relationships and consequent occupational problems, romantic relationships characterized by serious disruption or inappropriate submissiveness). Specific manifestations of personality disturbance are generally of moderate severity. Moderate Personality Disorder is sometimes associated with harm to self or others, and is associated with marked impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, although functioning in circumscribed areas may be maintained."

Problems in interpersonal functioning seriously affect virtually all relationships and the ability and willingness to perform expected social and occupational roles is absent or severely compromised. Specific manifestations of personality disturbance are severe and affect most, if not all, areas of personality functioning.

Onset is typically insidious with a gradual and worsening course. Several syndromic variants (some with an identified genetic basis or familiality) are described that include presentations with predominantly marked personality and behavioral changes (such as executive dysfunction, apathy, deterioration of social cognition, repetitive behaviours, and dietary changes) or with predominantly language deficits (that include semantic, agrammatic/nonfluent, and logopenic forms), or with a combination of these deficits. Memory function, psychomotor speed, as well as visuoperceptual and visuospatial abilities often remain relatively intact, particularly during the early stages of the disorder."

Onset of symptoms is related to exposure and progression can be rapid especially with acute exposure. In many cases, symptoms are reversible when exposure is identified and ceases. Investigations such as brain imaging or neurophysiological testing may be abnormal. Lead poisoning is associated with abnormalities on brain imaging including widespread calcification and increased signal on MRI T2-weighted images of periventricular white matter, basal ganglia hypothalamus and pons.

The trigeminal nuclear complex extends throughout the brainstem, hence it is susceptible to many pathologic processes including demyelination, ischemia, hemorrhage, infectious and non-infectious inflammation and neoplasm leading to symptoms of trigeminal nerve involvement. Compression of the sensory nerve root outside the brain stem by a vascular loop leads to trigeminal neuralgia. Symptoms and signs depend on the site of the lesion.

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients without underlying pulmonary disease, classically in tall, thin young men in their teens and 20s. It is thought to be due to spontaneous rupture of subpleural apical blebs or bullae that result from smoking or that are inherited. It generally occurs at rest, although some cases occur during activities involving reaching or stretching. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax also occurs during diving and high-altitude flying because of unequally transmitted pressure changes in the lung. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with underlying pulmonary disease. It most often results from rupture of a bleb or bulla in patients with severe COPD, HIV-related Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, cystic fibrosis, or any underlying pulmonary parenchymal disease Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is more serious than primary spontaneous pneumothorax because it occurs in patients whose underlying lung disease decreases their pulmonary reserve."

It occurs, for instance, in association with pneumonias, pleural effusions and pneumothorax. Anatomically, there is found an enlargement of the normal lung; there are no variations from the normal structure; the unaffected lung, as a result of distention, has an increased vital capacity and is able to perform a greater amount of work than when in its usual condition. The tissues show no similarity to those truly emphysematous. This change is in no way related to true emphysema and the term should not be used, as it creates great confusion in the literature. Its use is no more justified than that of speaking of the compensatory enlargement of a kidney, when the opposite kidney has been removed, as of a compensatory nephritis. True emphysema can never compensate for diseased lung tissue, because the emphysematous lung is totally or almost totally functionless."

http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1955327835	KA02.3	definition	"Placental insufficiency is defined as the inability of the placenta to deliver a sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, and therefore, is unable to sustain the growth of the developing baby until term. Placental insufficiency can result in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), pre-eclampsia, abruption, or preterm labour and delivery. A small placenta is defined as a placenta that weighs less that the lower limit of normal for the gestational period. A low placental weight can be the result of a maternal condition that is causing underperfusion of the placenta, such as pre-eclampsia or maternal hypertension. A small placenta may lead to IUGR, fetal malformations, or chromosomal anomalies."

It is recommended, however, that the more precise terms be used whenever possible for coding the latter lesions. This code is used by some as synonymous with the perimembranous, conoventricular, Type II, or the paramembranous defects.  It should not be used to code an inlet VSD, or the so-called atrioventricular canal VSD.  More specific terms exist for coding these entities. It is used by some to describe an isolated perimembranous VSD without extension, although it is unlikely that perimembranous defects exist in the absence of deficiency of their muscular perimeter. The conoventricular VSD with malalignment should be coded as an outlet defect, as should the perimembranous defect opening to the outlet of the right ventricle. All perimembranous defects, nonetheless, have part of their margins made up of fibrous continuity either between the leaflets of an atrioventricular and an arterial valve or, in the setting of double outlet right ventricle or overriding of the tricuspid valve, by fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves. Such defects can also extend to become doubly committed and juxta-arterial (conal septal hypoplasia) when there is also fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the arterial valves or when there is a common arterial valve. Specific codes exist for these variants, which ideally should not be coded using this term."

http://id.who.int/icd/entity/942572025	LB17.0	definition	"Anorectal malformations (ARMs) are birth defects (due to alterations in embryo development of hindgut or proctodeum) where the anus and rectum (the lower end of the digestive tract) do not develop properly. They occur in approximately 1 in 5000 live births. These comprise a wide spectrum of diseases, which can affect boys and girls, and involve the distal anus and rectum as well as the urinary and genital tracts. Several abnormalities can occur, including the following: A membrane may be present over the anal opening; The rectum may not connect to the anus (imperforate anus); The rectum may connect to a part of the urinary tract or the reproductive system through an abnormal passage called a fistula. The classification of ARMs is mainly based on the position of the rectal pouch relative to the puborectal sling, the presence or absence of fistulas, and the types and locations of the fistulas. The following classification is according to the level of the atretic rectal cul-de-sac with respect to the pubococcygeal line (the radiological landmark for the upper border or the levator ani muscle)."

Fractures of the condylar head show typical fracture lines either within the lateral pole zone, which may lead to loss of vertical height, or medially to the pole zone, with the latter ones usually not compromising the vertical condyle to disc and fossa relation. Fractures of the condylar neck and base can be differentiated according to radiologically based rules with regard to the proportion of the fracture line above and below the level of the sigmoid notch, and are basically subdivided according to the presence or absence of displacement or dislocation. Further parameters for definition are presence or absence of fragmentation, sideward displacement (medially or laterally), angulation of the superior main fragment and fracture-site geometry (e.g. straight or oblique, interfragmentary interdigitation)"

http://id.who.int/icd/entity/2063689880	NA03.0	definition	"Displacement of the mandible, the largest and strongest bone of the face constituting the lower jaw. Dislocation of the temporomandibular joint is a painful condition that occurs when the mandibular condyle becomes fixed in the anterosuperior aspect of the articular eminence.
				TMJ dislocation is due to either trauma or, more commonly, excessive opening of the mandible. Spasm of the masseter, temporalis, and internal pterygoid muscles results in trismus, preventing return of the condyle to the temporal fossa."

In some cases, (for example, drowning and frostbite), injuries result from the sudden lack of essential agents such as oxygen or heat¡¯.
					Injuries may be categorized in a number of ways. However, for most analytical purposes and for identifying intervention opportunities, it is especially useful to categorize injuries according to whether or not they were deliberately inflicted and by whom. Commonly used categories are:
				
				
					unintentional (i.e. accidental)
					intentional (i.e. deliberate):
					interpersonal (e.g. assault and homicide)
					self-harm (e.g. abuse of drugs and alcohol, self-mutilation, suicide)
					legal intervention (e.g. action by police or other law enforcement personnel)
					war, civil insurrection and disturbances (e.g. demonstrations and riots)
					undetermined intent

This list represents a union set of harmonized traditional medicine conditions of the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean classifications. For an extended list of traditional medicine conditions, please refer to the International Classification of Traditional Medicine (ICTM).
				Key Definitions in ICTM:
				A disorder in traditional medicine, disorder (TM1)*, refers to a set of dysfunctions in any of the body systems which presents with associated manifestations, i.e. a single or a group of specified signs, symptoms, or findings. Each disorder (TM1) may be defined by its symptomology, etiology, course and outcome, or treatment response. 1 Symptomology: signs, symptoms or unique findings by traditional medicine diagnostic methods, including inspection such as tongue examination, history taking (inquiry), listening and smelling examination, palpation such as pulse taking, abdominal examination, and other methods. 2 TM Etiology: the underlying traditional medicine explanatory style, such as environmental factors (historically known in TM translations as the external contractions), emotional factors (historically known in TM translations as the seven emotions), or other pathological factors, processes, and products. 3 Course and outcome: a unique path of development of the disorder (TM1) over time. 4 Treatment response: known response to traditional medicine interventions. In defining a disorder (TM1), symptomology and etiology are required. Course and outcome, and treatment response are optional.
				A pattern in traditional medicine, pattern (TM1), refers to the complete clinical presentation of the patient at a given moment in time including all findings. Findings may include symptomology or patient constitution, among other things. 1 Symptomology (as above). 2 Constitution: the characteristics of an individual, including structural and functional characteristics, temperament, ability to adapt to environmental changes, or susceptibility to various health conditions. This is relatively stable, being in part genetically determined while partially acquired.
				The use of the ICD-11 TM Chapter is optional for those who would like to record epidemiological data about traditional medicine practice. This chapter should not be used for mortality reporting.
				* 'TM1' refers to Traditional Medicine conditions - Module I. The (TM1) designation is used throughout this chapter for every traditional medicine diagnostic category in order to be clearly distinguishable from conventional medicine concepts."
